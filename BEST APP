Well there are many apps that are mind blowing but the one that comes to mind because of my recent use is AMAZON.

AMAZON according to me is the best among the online shopping apps because FIRST of all: it is very complex app(I KNOW THIS FOR A FACT BECAUSE I HAD TRIED TO REPLICATE IT DURING
ISTE'S APP-DEV SMP IT CONSISTS OF FRAGMENTS WITHIN FRAGMENTS, SEARCH BARS, VOICE SEARCH, API CALLS ARE ALSO MADE IN IT.) SECOND: consumer-wise it is best according to me as it has
a product related to each search. For instance lately I was searching a product on flipkart but it showed nothing found but on AMAZON although it didn't show mw the same exact 
product but a related one. 

So AMAZON is the best app according to me and all the reasons that I could think of are mentioned above.
